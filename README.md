# Last-100-years-Earthquake-Data-Analysis
Here, I did some data analysis using the last 100+ years of Earthquake data covering South Asia and Bangladesh region

This was a web scraping project along with dashboard visualization on Tableau.

I scraped and extracted data from a website using python with the help of request and BeautifulSoup libraries.
The source of the data was this [website](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/bangladesh/largest.html).

This project aimed to scrape and extract data for data analysis on Earthquakes data encompassing Bangladesh and other neighboring countries like India, Myanmar & Nepal. This analysis was done to get insights of the data like what were the magnitudes of the Earthquakes that took place over the last few years, where, occured mostly on which month and in which region and more.
The insights from the extracted data were later visualized using the popular data visualization tool, Tableau.


Here's the link to the Tableau Dashboard for the scraped data: Earthquake Data Tableau Dashboard (7 Sheets)
